# Spatial distributions of capelin in Atlantis GOA

This code produces spatial distributions of capelin (*Mallotus villosus*) for the Atlantis GOA model.  

Capelin is not sampled extensively by bottom trawl surveys, and producing reliable maps with sdmTMB like for the groundfish was not possible. Here we map to the Atlantis geometry the synoptic distribution maps (20x20 nmi resolution) created by Dave McGowan ([McGowan et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.3354/meps13211)).
